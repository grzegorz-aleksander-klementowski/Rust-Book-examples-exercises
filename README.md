# Rust Book Examples

This repository contains a collection of "Rust Book Examples" – small applications modified and, in some cases, extended from the official Rust Documentation: [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## Structure

Examples are organized into folders that correspond to specific chapters in the book. Each chapter folder is further divided into "Examples" and "Exercises" sections. This division is made because the book occasionally includes exercises for practice.

### Examples

The "Examples" folder does not include every example from the textbook. It focuses on larger or more interesting code snippets found in the book. Some small examples may be combined into a single project.

### Exercises

The "Exercises" section contains my solutions to the exercises presented in the textbook, along with examples that the authors suggest or encourage readers to implement independently.

## Project Contents

The repository includes only the source code along with the Cargo.toml and lock files.

## Why Rust Book Examples and Exercises on My GitHub Page?

Rust is a highly specific programming language, and I believe it's crucial not only to understand how to write code in Rust but also to grasp its underlying philosophy. This realization dawned on me when I discovered that even experienced programmers faced challenges with Rust's unique approach. Therefore, I consider knowledge of Rust theory as essential. To demonstrate my understanding, I have uploaded partially modified examples and exercises that I wrote myself based on the book. Additionally, I wanted to share my solutions and examples with others who may find them useful.

## Chapters:

1. Getting Started
2. Programming a Guessing Game
3. Common Programming Concepts
4. Understanding Ownership
5. Using Structs to Structure Related Data
6. Enums and Pattern Matching
7. Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules.
